        "Answer:\n",
        "NumPy is a Python library used for high-performance array computing and numerical operations. It provides fast operations, broadcasting, and is the foundation for libraries like Pandas and SciPy.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Broadcasting allows operations on arrays of different shapes. The smaller array is automatically expanded to match the shape of the larger array without copying data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A DataFrame is a 2D table-like data structure in Pandas with labeled rows and columns, similar to an Excel spreadsheet, used for structured data manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The groupby() method groups data based on one or more columns and allows aggregate functions like sum(), mean() to be applied to each group.\n",
